For our data analysis project, we decided to use data related to National Football League (NFL) games dating back to 1999. To access this data, we will be using the nfl-data-py (https://pypi.org/project/nfl-data-py/) Python library, which will allow us to import numerous different datasets including play-by-play data, weekly data, and seasonal data. This data is sourced from nflfastR, nfldata, dynastyprocess, and Draft Scout.

The sport of American Football is very complex and requires plenty of game planning and strategy, especially at the professional level. As avid football fans, we are very excited to analyze the progression of the game of football at its highest level and analyze how the strategy of the game has changed over time. We aim to observe the patterns of each game over the past 25 years to draw conclusions about what has changed about the strategy of the game, and how we think the sport will continue to change.
